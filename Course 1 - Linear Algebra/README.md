# Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra

In this course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to vectors and matrices. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them, including the knotty problem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how to use these to solve problems. Finally we look at how to use these to do fun things with datasets - like how to rotate images of faces and how to extract eigenvectors to look at how the Pagerank algorithm works.
Since we're aiming at data-driven applications, we'll be implementing some of these ideas in code, not just on pencil and paper. Towards the end of the course, you'll write code blocks and encounter Jupyter notebooks in Python, but don't worry, these will be quite short, focussed on the concepts, and will guide you through if youâ€™ve not coded before.

At the end of this course you will have an intuitive understanding of vectors and matrices that will help you bridge the gap into linear algebra problems, and how to apply these concepts to machine learning.

## Books

In the UK, we tend to write our courses from scratch based on what we think is important to include and introduce things in the order we think presents the material in the most elegant and illuminating way - we don't just go through a particular set textbook. So there isn't an exact 'model text' that we are following in this course. But, our way of thinking about things is informed by the textbooks we use, the teachers who taught us, how we use things in research and by interactions with our own students - so of course all sorts of textbooks are useful.

1. In Imperial Engineering, our primary maths textbook is probably the ever-popular and accessible Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences by Mary L Boas, John Wiley and Sons, 3rd Ed, 2006. Linear Algebra is in Chapter 3. Most Engineering maths textbooks are also useful, although they often teach 'vectors and matrices' rather than viewing linear algebra as an integrated whole.

2. In US graduate school classes people often use Introduction to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang, Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 5th Ed, 2016. http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/

## Web Resources

There are, of course, a whole bunch of useful web resources on linear algebra - many of which were helpful to us in preparing this course! These might also be handy to you - typically they go a bit slower or have a different emphasis or way of explaining things, but it can be handy to see how someone else explains something.

1. Khan Academy is a great resource right up to 1st or 2nd year undergraduate material. For this course, there's a handy group of videos at https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra

2. Grant Sanderson has a great series of videos developing mathematical intuition on YouTube, which you can reach through his site http://www.3blue1brown.com

3. Wikipedia gets better every year - and the linear algebra wikipedia pages are actually pretty good. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra
